`Example`
- Control ROBOTIS DREAM robots using Bluetooth communication
  - Connect the BT-410 SLAVE module onto the DREAM controller (CM-150).
  - Control the DREAM robot by connecting an Android/iOS smart device with BT-410.
- Edit the motion for ROBOTIS MINI using Bluetooth communication
  - Connect the BT-410 SLAVE onto OpenCM9.04 and run R+ m.Motion on an Android/iOS smart device
  - Search for BT-410 on the smart device and connect
  - Use the R+ m.Motion App to edit and download the motion for ROBOTIS MINI

`Caution`
Please make sure to turn off the controller before connecting the Bluetooth module. The device may cause malfunction or be damaged if connected while the controller is turned on.

# [Communication Mode](#communication-mode)

Utilizes a pairing mechanism that allows reliable 1:1 communication.

## [1:1 Communication](1-1-communication)

- Once the power is supplied to the Bluetooth module, the blue LED will blink. When pairing is successful, the blue LED will stay on (solid).

# [BT-410 Setting](bt-410-setting)
Can reset system, change device name, and set SLAVE address, but CAN NOT change mode.

1. Download the "f_SerialUSB_Serial2_Converter" example for the OpenCM 9.04 using OpenCM IDE.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_02.png)

2. Use the USB port to connect the OpenCM9.04 to the PC, install the driver, then connect using the Tera Term terminal program through the respective COM port.

    - `Download` [Tera Term](http://www.robotis.com/download/software/teraterm-4.73.zip)

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_03.png)

3. Connection is complete if the status is similar to the image shown below. The baud rate can be any value.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_05.png)

4. Go to Setup -> Terminal and check the “Local echo” box.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_06.png)

5. At the terminal, input “!” to display “OK”, to enter the command mode. Input “AT” and press enter to keep on displaying “OK”, which means the BT-410 has successfully connected.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_07.png)

6. Once terminal setup is complete, disconnect and reconnect the BT-410 to the OpenCM9.04 to check the SLAVE/MASTER mode it is in. The image below shows the MASTER mode.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_02.gif)

7. Searching for peripheral devices only works when the BT-410 is in MASTER mode. As seen in the image below, input “AT+BTINQ” and press enter to display devices nearby with the device class 0x1F00(SPP).

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_03.jpg)

8. For connecting the device, search for the device with the “AT+BTINQ” command, then enter the Bluetooth address that is displayed (hexadecimal number, 12 digits) to pair.  
  For example, for the image above, enter the same address abc2-ff-123458 without the “-“ (i.e. ATDabc2ff123458) then press enter to attempt a connection  
  Pairing won’t work if the PIN code between the devices don’t match, so please check the code first (default is 0000).

# [AT Commands](#at-commands)

The followings are AT terminal commands for the BT-410

1. System Reset  
  Enter ATZ press the Enter key and the BT-410 resets.if settings have changed the mode will change upon reset.

2. Peripheral Device Search  
  Searching for peripheral devices only works when the BT-410 is in MASTER mode. As seen in the image below, input “AT+BTINQ” and press enter to display devices nearby with the device class 0x1F00(SPP).             

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_06.png)

3. Connecting devices (pairing)  
  For connecting the device, search for the device with the “AT+BTINQ” command, then enter the Bluetooth address that is displayed (hexadecimal number, 12 digits) to pair.  
  For example, for the image above, enter the same address abc2-ff-123458 without the “-“ (i.e. ATDabc2ff123458) then press enter to attempt a connection.  
  Pairing won’t work if the PIN code between the devices doesn’t match, so please check the code first (default is 0000).

4. Changing Bluetooth device name  
  AT+BTNAME = "NAME OF NEW DEVICE NAME"

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_08.gif)

5. Reconfiguring pairing.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_09.gif)

6. Enable/Disable Auto Pairing (**REV2, Only applicable for MASTER module with a blue marker**)  
  - `Disable` Enter the command "AT+BTAUTOPAIR=0"

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_10.png)

    - After a few seconds, below message will be displayed.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_11.png)

    - `Enable` Enter the command "AT+BTAUTOPAIR=1"

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_12.png)

    - After a few seconds, below message will be displayed.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_13.png)

7. Change Baudrate  
  AT+BTUART,baudrate,parity_bit,stop_bit  
  `Example` AT+BTUART,57600,n,1  

`Note` BT-410's mode is unchangeable and can only be used at its default set mode. (Slave/Slave or Master/Master can not be paired)
